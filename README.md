<h2> Pre-requisites </h2>

- Python
- Docker
- Being comfortable with command line
- Prior exposure to machine learning (at work or from other courses, e.g. from ML Zoomcamp)
- Prior programming experience (at least 1+ year)

<h2> Running example </h2>
<p>To make it easier to connect different modules together, we’d like to use the same running example throughout the course.

  - Possible candidates:
  https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page - predict the ride duration or if the driver is going to be tipped or not </p>


<h2> Instructors </h2>
